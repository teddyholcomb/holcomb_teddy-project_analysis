			<h2>Site Intent</h2>
				<article class="siteintent">
					<h3>Goals for Redesign</h3>
						<p>The intent for this project is a full redesign of Spring Lake 
						Elementary School’s website. The main priority in this redesign 
						is to help cleanup the look, feel, and navigation of their website. 
						By giving the code some long awaited attention and thinning out their 
						navigation the site will be able to take it’s first steps into having 
						the look and feel of a 21st century website. With this newly added 
						organization, Spring Lake’s website won’t turn people away from 
						using it, but instead make it an informational outlet that anyone 
						will be able to navigate through for important information.
						</p>
					<h3>Additional Touch-Ups</h3>
						<p>Another project will be to touch-up the initial look of the website with a facelift. 
						A change that won’t give the user the feeling that they’ve went 
						back in time visiting the site. The school’s logo will also need 
						some touching up, but not a total re-working. Ultimately the goal 
						is to make this website very user friendly and keep the user involved 
						on all the new info and events happening at Spring Lake Elementary.

			<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
				<article class="analysis">
					<p>It seems that Spring Lake’s only real competition are the other 
					elementary schools in their district. There are quite a few elementary 
					schools for a user to choose from in the districts catalog of schools. 
					After looking at a few of the other school’s websites it’s clear to see 
					that with the redesign of Spring Lake’s website, they will stand out 
					from the rest.</p>
						<h3>Demographics</h3>
							<p>Based on studies through the internet, females ranging from age 
							35-44 visit k12.fl.us most often. They have children and have also 
							received some college education. The primary browsing spot for 
							Spring Lake’s users is from their home and their average household 
							income is anywhere from $60K - $100K yearly.</p>
						<h3>Keywords</h3>
							<p>You must use web services like Alexa and Google Adwords in order 
							to find any keywords for the current site, as there are no visible 
							keywords in the meta tags in the sites markup. Some of the keywords 
							found through these services are spring lake elementary, 
							seminole county schools, spring lake, elementary school.</p>
						<h3>Site Statistics</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>At least 34.63% of users get to the site from google.com 
							and 4.71% or less through other sites.</li>
							<li>Average load time for the housing site k12.fl.us 
							is 0.958 seconds. 75% of other sites are slower.</li>
							<li>Average time spent on the site is anywhere from 4 – 5 minutes.</li>
						</ul>

			<h2>Target Audience</h2>		
				<article class="target">
					<p>According to research through analysis systems, I’ve come to the 
					conclusion that the target audience for the Spring Lake site is 
					primarily residential. The specific user researching information about 
					what school they would like to enroll their child appears to be mothers. 
					The ethnicity of the users is primarily Caucasian and African American.</p>
					<p>The mother that has been identified as the main user through research 
					has basic web navigational skills, so the site needs to be laid out in 
					such a way that she can easily navigate through the site and find anything 
					she is looking for. This could be a typical 9 to 5 working mother and 
					quite possibly raising her child/children on her own.</p>
